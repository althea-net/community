# Althea Network Builder Community

Althea networks are networks built using the Althea ecosystem, which includes the protocol, software on devices, and connectivity hardware. The builder community ranges from hobbyist developers and DIY tinkerers to largescale network operators who climb trees to install antennas. Regardless of what scale you're wanting to build at, you can benefit from the experience and expertise of our community of Althea network builders.

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the community of builders. You may get help with your builds, commit code, write docs, test product features, report bugs, organize meetups, suggest ideas for new features, get organized to cooperatively build with others near you, and more.

### Getting help with your network build

Whenever in doubt, the best thing to do is [jump right into the Discord](https://discord.gg/hHx7HxcycF) and introduce yourself. That will give others a chance to help direct you to the right resources and answer specific questions you might have.

### Getting started with contributing code

The telecom stack and core management and billing software for Althea is called Rita.

> Rita is the glue that ties together the different components of the Althea system. It manages the price aware Babeld implementation and interacts with the Linux kernel in different ways to create the Althea network.

> Rita discovers peers on physical interfaces and uses WireGuard to build a network of authenticated tunnels. This authentication is used for billing purposes. Rita then attaches Babeld on top of this network of WireGuard tunnels creating the internal routing network for the Althea mesh.

Some builders work specifically on the Rita software. To view, modify, or contribute new code to Rita, [visit the Github repo for Rita here](https://github.com/althea-net/althea_rs).

You can get help getting started with or contributing for Rita in the [Althea development channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/477147257251299350/499386519660920832).

### Writing docs

The Althea docs that cover all aspects of setting up a router to setting up a network are [available here](https://docs.althea.net/).

<i>The docs are not presently open to contribute to but we're working on it!</i>


### Reporting bugs / suggesting features

If you have encountered a bug or have an issue with the Rita software, you can file a new issue on the [Github repo for Rita here](https://github.com/althea-net/althea_rs) or if it's something you might just need help with or want to discuss first, you can do so in the [Althea development channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/477147257251299350/499386519660920832).

### Organize local meetups / Althea events

Local meetups can be both fun and educational, socializing with other builders near you and sharing experiences and discussing plans. Anyone can organize an informal meetup, but you can find more information on past meetups here to help you.

If you'd like you'd like to organize an official Althea, please use [this form to register](https://7g6dv3aozqg.typeform.com/to/LWMcBqtI) and the Althea team will reach out to you.
